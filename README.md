# Weather Data Analysis Project 🌦️

## 📌 Task Overview:
This project was part of a Python and pandas practice assignment. The goal was to analyze a real-world weather dataset and answer 15 specific data-related questions using Python.

## 🧠 Skills Used:
- Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Pandas Filtering, Aggregation
- Descriptive Statistics
- Logical Conditions

## ✅ Questions Answered:
1. Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.
2. Count how many times the weather is exactly Clear.
3. Count how many times wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.
4. Find all Null values in the data.
5. Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'.
6. What is the mean Visibility?
7. What is the standard deviation of Pressure?
8. What is the variance of Relative Humidity?
9. Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
10. Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.
11. What is the mean value of each column against each Weather Condition?
12. What is the Min & Max value of each column against each Weather Condition?
13. Show all records where Weather Condition is Fog.
14. Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.
15. Find all instances when:
    - Weather is Clear and Relative Humidity > 50, or
    - Visibility is above 40.
